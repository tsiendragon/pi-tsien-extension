# `/goal` acceptance criteria

This checklist records release status for the Pi `/goal` extension.

Status key:

- **Automated**: covered by unit or integration-style tests.
- **Manual smoke**: harness coverage exists, but a real Pi TUI check is still required.
- **Future work**: intentionally not implemented in this rollout.

## Release baseline and packaging

## Validation commands

Run this checklist before release:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run format
npm test
npm run test:coverage
npm pack --dry-run
npm run smoke:pi
npm run smoke:package
```

`npm run smoke:package` derives its minimum pairing from the peer dependency floors and its latest validated pairing from the development dependencies. Environment overrides run one custom pairing for targeted checks.

Live interactive TUI lifecycle checks are a **release-blocking evidence gap until recorded in a real terminal**. Do not count automated harness tests as proof for `/reload`, `/resume`, `/tree`, `/fork`, `/compact`, or the visible widget in a real TUI session.

## Manual session lifecycle smoke checklist

Automation covers reducer, command parsing, import safety and merge behavior, tools, hidden context, compaction hooks, continuation guards, UI renderers, and branch-shaped reconstruction. It does not prove the live TUI.

Before release, run these checks in a real TUI session and record command sequence, expected state, observed result, Pi/package version, terminal mode, and screenshots or transcript snippets when available.

1. Start Pi with the extension:

   ```bash
   pi --no-extensions -e ./extensions/index.ts
   ```

2. Run `/goal` and confirm usage renders without starting an agent turn.
3. Run `/goal Ship a multi-turn verification goal`. Confirm the command asks the chat agent to draft with `propose_goal_draft` and wait for review UI.
4. Choose Cancel and confirm no goal is saved.
5. Run the goal command again, choose Edit, confirm the modal markdown draft has objective and acceptance criteria fields, change one criterion, then choose Start and confirm one follow-up agent turn is queued.
6. Run `/goal start` and confirm one follow-up agent turn is queued for the active goal.
7. Run `/goal status`, `/goal pause`, `/goal resume --start`, `/goal complete --yes`, and `/goal clear --yes`. Confirm status output and active-goal widget update or disappear at each step. Confirm resume `--start` queues only the explicit handoff.
8. Create `docs/prd.md`, run `/goal import docs/prd.md`, review confirmation, and confirm `/goal status` shows source docs and extracted criteria.
9. Import a second doc into the same goal and confirm source docs, constraints, and criteria merge without replacing the objective.
10. Repeat a non-interactive import with `--yes --start` and confirm it starts immediately.
11. Trigger `/compact`; confirm `/goal status` still shows objective, criteria, source brief, and progress. Then send a normal prompt and verify hidden goal context is regenerated for the active goal.
12. Run `/reload` or restart/resume the session. Confirm the active-goal widget and `/goal status` reconstruct from current branch custom entries.
13. Use `/fork` or `/tree` to navigate between branches with different goal mutations. Confirm each branch shows its own goal state and stale context from the other branch is absent.
14. Start Pi with the default continuation behavior (or explicitly tune its budgets):

    ```bash
    pi --no-extensions -e ./extensions/index.ts --goal-continuation-max-duration-hours 48 --goal-continuation-max-turns 0 --goal-continuation-max-no-progress-turns 2
    ```

15. Update progress through `update_goal_progress`, then let idle continuation queue. Confirm it stops after no progress or the max-turn cap and does not duplicate the queue.
16. Confirm automatic continuation is distinct from `/goal start` and `--start`; it should queue only while Pi is idle unless `--goal-continuation=false` was supplied. Also run `/goal blockers --markdown` and inspect the Powerline progress status.
17. Run quick non-interactive load checks:

    ```bash
    pi --no-session --no-extensions -e ./extensions/index.ts -p /goal
    pi --no-session --no-extensions -e ./extensions/index.ts --goal-continuation -p /goal
    ```

18. Run package and targeted coverage checks:

    ```bash
    npm run smoke:package
    npm run test:coverage
    ```

## Definition of done

The rollout is ready when automated checks pass, package contents are verified, docs links are reviewed, and live TUI lifecycle evidence is recorded.

Release readiness is currently blocked until live TUI smoke evidence is recorded for `/reload`, `/resume`, `/tree`, `/fork`, `/compact`, and the visible active-goal widget.

Future work remains Codex-exact compatibility: app-server RPC, exact token/time budgets, and exact Codex goal menu UI.
